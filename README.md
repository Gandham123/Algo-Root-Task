## **Features & Functionality**  

### **1. Add Tasks**  
- Users can enter a task **title** and **description**.  
- If either field is empty, an **error message** is displayed, preventing submission.  
- Clicking the **"Add"** button sends the task to the **backend**, where it is stored in a **MongoDB database**.  
- The newly added task appears under the **"Pending Tasks"** tab.  

### **2. Pending Tasks Management**  
Each pending task displays:  
- A **human-readable timestamp** (e.g., "5 minutes ago").  
- Options to:  
  - **Edit**: Modify the task title or description, with changes updated in both the frontend and database.  
  - **Delete**: Remove tasks permanently from both the frontend and database.  

### **3. Task Completion**  
- Users can mark tasks as **completed**, moving them to the **"Completed Tasks"** tab.  
- This maintains a clear separation between **ongoing** and **finished** tasks.  

### **4. Completed Tasks Management**  
- Completed tasks are displayed in a separate **"Completed Tasks"** tab.  
- Users can **permanently delete** completed tasks, with changes reflected in the database.  

### **5. Validation & Error Handling**  
- **Frontend Validation**: Ensures both **title** and **description** fields are filled before submission.  
- **Error Messages**: Guide users to enter valid data.  
- **Server-Side Error Handling**: Manages issues like database connection failures or invalid requests, displaying appropriate messages for a smooth user experience.
